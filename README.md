# -Reducing-Commercial-Aviation-Fatalities
🛫 Most flight-related fatalities stem from a loss of “airplane state awareness.” That is, ineffective attention management on the part of pilots who may be distracted, sleepy or in other dangerous cognitive states.🧯 🔺 Your challenge is to build a ❗️model to detect troubling events from aircrew’s physiological data❗️. You'll use data acquired from actual pilots in test situations,📊 and your models should be able to run calculations in real time⏳ to monitor the cognitive states of pilots. With your help, pilots could then be alerted when they enter a troubling state, preventing accidents and saving lives.🛬
